Welcome to my app for travel enthusiasts built with React, Node.js, Cloudinary, Swiper and React Beautiful DnD! With this tool, you can easily plan and organize your trip by adding travel, restaurant, hotel, and activity cards to your daily itinerary. You can customize your itinerary by adding/modifying costs, cards, and adding notes. When your trip is finished, you can save it to your list of past trips for future reference.
